(ˉ﹃ˉ) Hello human, I am Panhilios I have empirical knowledge of Python, C++, and C#, and I also know how to use the Qiskit library.
(⊙ˍ⊙) I am developing a project that is really quantum, about the quantum, with neural implants, really quantum, for the creation of a new network that is more secure than the secure ones.
I love Cruissant
